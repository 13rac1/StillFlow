# Logo Ideas for Still Flow

This document captures the creative concepts and implementations for the Still Flow app logo.

## Design Philosophy

The logo should embody the app's core purpose: providing calming ambient sounds for sleep and meditation. Key themes:
- **Stillness** - Peace, calm, tranquility
- **Flow** - Gentle movement, water, natural rhythm
- **Sleep-friendly** - Dark theme, soothing colors
- **Minimalist** - Clean, simple, scales well at small sizes

## Concept Ideas

### 1. Minimalist Water Drop + Ripple ✅ Implemented
**File:** `assets/images/logo.svg`

A single water drop creating concentric circular ripples.
- Represents both stillness (calm water) and flow (the ripples)
- Works well at small sizes, clean and modern
- Blue color scheme (#4a9eff) matching water theme
- Radial gradient on drop for depth
- Three ripples with varying opacity

**Pros:**
- Highly versatile and scalable
- Instantly recognizable
- Perfect for app icons
- Simple but elegant

### 2. Zen Circle (Ensō) with Wave  (Not Yet Implemented)

An incomplete brushstroke circle with gentle wave patterns inside.
- Combines meditation aesthetics with flowing water
- Elegant, spiritual, calming
- Layered brushstroke effect with texture details
- Multiple flowing waves inside the circle

**Pros:**
- Spiritual/meditation connection
- Artistic and unique
- Strong cultural resonance
- Beautiful at larger sizes

**Cons:**
- More detail may be harder to see at very small icon sizes

### 3. Moon Over Water (Not Yet Implemented)
Crescent moon reflection on rippling water surface.
- Evokes nighttime/sleep while suggesting gentle movement
- Fits the dark theme and sleep focus
- Could combine moon phase with water ripples

### 4. Abstract Sound Wave as Water (Not Yet Implemented)
Sound waveform that morphs into a water stream or rain drops.
- Literally represents "sound" + "flow"
- Modern, tech-forward but organic
- Could animate beautifully in splash screens

### 5. Rainfall Gradient (Not Yet Implemented)
Stylized rain drops falling into water (gradient from top to bottom).
- Simple geometric shapes (circles/teardrops)
- Can animate beautifully in splash screens
- Represents the rain sounds feature directly

## Current Implementations

### Water Drop + Ripple (logo.svg)
- **Size:** 512x512
- **Background:** Dark (#1a1a2e)
- **Drop color:** Blue (#4a9eff) with radial gradient highlight
- **Ripples:** 3 concentric circles at radii 100, 150, 200
- **Line thickness:** 14/16/18px with varying opacity
